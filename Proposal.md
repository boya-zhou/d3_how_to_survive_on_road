# Background and Motivation

In recent years, many safety actions, such as increase in seat belt use and reduction in impaired driving, have helped decrease the number of traffic deaths. However, newly released government data paint a sobering picture of safety on the nation's roads and highways. Despite decades of safety improvements, the number of people who died in auto accidents reached 35,092 last year, according to newly released figures from the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration. That's a 7.2% increase over 2014. The last time there was a large single-year increase was back in 1966, when fatalities rose 8.1 percent from the previous year.

Based on above information, we want to seek out the reasons behind the fatalities increase, which include but go beyond key factors contributing to the increase and high risk communities.


# Project Objectives

#### Primary Question
- How might travel mode change affects fatal crashes?
- How might climate change increase the risk of fatal crashes in a community?
- How might we use studies of attitudes toward speeding, distracted driving, and seat belt use to better target marketing and behavioral change campaigns?

#### Benefits
Find the factors contributing to the traffic fatalities, and seek ways to improve safety on the roads.


# Data
The data was released by the the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (https://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2016/08/29/2015-traffic-fatalities-data-has-just-been-released-call-action-download-and-analyze).

# Data Processing
As the data needed are separated in several documents, join manipulation might be required. In this case, we use Python for implementation.
